# Sign-Up Form

This project features a modern and minimalist sign-up form that collects the user's email and password. The form includes basic validation for the email and password fields, ensuring the password meets specific security criteria before submission.

## Features

### Email Field
Automatic validation of the email format (thanks to the browser's built-in validation).

### Password Field
The password must meet specific security criteria before it can be submitted:
- At least 8 characters long.
- One uppercase letter.
- One lowercase letter.
- One digit.
- One special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.).

### Error Handling
If the password does not meet the criteria, an error message will appear to inform the user.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the form and elements.
- **CSS**: Minimalistic and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Validation of input fields and error handling.
